**BaliTrip: An AHP-Based Mobile Recommender System for Optimizing Local Tourist and Dining Options in Balingasag, Misamis Oriental**  

BaliTrip is a mobile recommender system designed to help tourists optimize their travel and dining experiences.  
It integrates a **Decision Support System (DSS)** with the **Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)** to recommend attractions and restaurants that best fit user preferences and budgets.

## 📌 Objectives
- Provide tourists with **optimized travel itineraries**.  
- Help users select **local tourist attractions and dining options** based on preferences.  
- Support travelers in managing **budget constraints** while planning trips.

## 🔎 How It Works
1. **User Input**  
   - Tourists enter their login details, preferences (e.g., type of attractions, dining style), and travel budget.  

2. **Recommendation Engine**  
   - The **AHP algorithm** processes these inputs.  
   - Pairwise comparison is used to weigh criteria (e.g., price, accessibility, services, activities).  
   - Options are ranked and optimized to generate the best matches.  

3. **Itinerary Generation**  
   - Users receive recommendations for attractions/dining within their budget.  
   - They can finalize and save their itinerary directly in the app.
